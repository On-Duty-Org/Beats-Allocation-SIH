# SIH Admin Dashboard 
## Beats Allocation and Tracking
In police terminology, a beat is the territory and time that a police officer patrols
### Live Demo
[See the live demo here](https://ishank-dev.github.io/Beats-Allocation-SIH/fly.html)
### Workflow
1. The police officers are assigned their zones via the admin dashboard.
2. An SMS is sent along with the place details the area is also marked on the map that needs to be patrolled. 
3. If the police officer has internet connectivity, he can get directions about how he has to navigate to a specific place.
4. The police can send live alerts that gets displayed on the same map marked as a pulsing dot to alert other police officers.
5. Zones and police are customisable and can be used by different police stations matching their unique requirements.
### Technical Workflow
The frontend interacts with the REST-APIs and displays them on map.
